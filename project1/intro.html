      <h2>a short reflection</h2>
      <h3>date: oct. 15th, 2025</h3>
      <p>
        as my time at berkeley comes to an end, i've had some time to think
        about how much i've grown in the past three years. in comparison to my
        pre-college self, i can confidently say that i've changed so much in all
        directions that i can hardly recognize freshman year self. i've pushed
        myself harder than i ever thought i could, made friends with people i
        didn't think i could get along with, and i've come to embrace the
        uncertainty that my future holds. i think a few things have been
        constant. i still get anxious at times. i have more or less the same
        sense of humor. but almost everything else about me then has been shaped
        by the people around me and the obstacles i've faced on the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        i think one big thing that i've developed while in college is that
        desire to constantly grow and improve myself. saying that i'm never
        satisfied with myself is putting it a little harshly, but i hardly feel
        like i'm in a spot where i can just relax and be content with where i
        am. this isn't necessarily a negative thing, because i really do think
        the ambition i have to remain active at all times has helped me learn so
        much, gain valuable experience, and make many cool friends. but i have
        found myself wondering when, if ever, i'll reach a point where i feel
        like i've mastered something, whether it's in a professional environment
        or anything lifestyle related. i think part of it is out of my desire to
        make the most of this precious time in my life where i can make mistakes
        and explore all sorts of things before locking in on a specific path, so
        the anxiety of settling on one thing for the rest of my life probably
        plays a part. but i do hope that i'm stil able to learn new things all
        the time, even after graduating.
      </p>

        anyways, just a few thoughts as i'm sitting in doe at 1:27 am. thanks
        for reading!
